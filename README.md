<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

BSLegacyLauncher is a program designed to fetch any version of Beat Saber from Steam's depots, and launch it within the same program! 
<br/>You do not need to move it to your Steam directory, as your current installation will remain untouched!
</br>So if you ever want to switch between two versions, this is the program for you!


### Built With

* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [DepotDownloader.Library](https://github.com/ddakebono/DepotDownloader)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How To Use

 - Simply download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/RiskiVR/BSLegacyLauncher/releases/latest).
 - Once that's done, extract it and run "Beat Saber Legacy Launcher.exe" in the folder.
 - From there follow the buttons and prompts to select the target version, and log into your steam account!



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Having problems?

See the [open issues](https://github.com/RiskiVR/BSLegacyLauncher/issues) for a list of known issues, from there you can create a new issue for the problem you have!
</br>Othewise you can add on to existing issues if one matches what you're encountering.
