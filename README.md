<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Ever wanted or needed to have the ability to switch between any versions? Then this is the program for you!
<br/>
<br/>BSLegacyLauncher is a program designed to fetch any version of Beat Saber from Steam's depots, and launch it within the same program! 
<br/>You can install up to as many versions as you want and quickly switch between them!
<br/>You can even create a Master CustomLevels folder linked across all versions!
<br/>Your current Steam install will remain untouched!

### Built With

* [Unity](https://unity.com/)
* [DepotDownloader](https://github.com/SteamRE/DepotDownloader)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## How To Use

 - Simply download the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/RiskiVR/BSLegacyLauncher/releases/latest).
 - Once that's done, extract it and run "Beat Saber Legacy Launcher.exe" in the folder.
 - From there follow the buttons and prompts to select the target version, and log into your steam account!
 - *To launch your Launcher install via Steam, add a Steam shortcut to `Beat Saber Legacy Launcher.exe` 
  </br> then add `--LaunchBS` to Launch Options*
